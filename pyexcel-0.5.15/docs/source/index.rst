Introduction
-------------

**pyexcel** provides **one** application programming interface to read,
manipulate and write data in various excel formats. This library makes
information processing involving excel files an enjoyable task. The data in
excel files can be turned into :ref:`array or dict<a-list-of-data-structures>`
with minimal code and vice versa. This library focuses on data
processing using excel files as storage media hence fonts, colors and charts
were not and will not be considered.

The idea originated from the common usability problem: when an excel file
driven web application is delivered for non-developer users (ie: team assistant,
human resource administrator etc). The fact is that not everyone knows (or cares) about the
differences between various excel formats: csv, xls, xlsx are all the same to them. Instead of training those users
about file formats, this library helps web developers to handle most of the excel file
formats by providing a common programming interface. To add a specific excel file format type
to you application, all you need is to install an extra pyexcel plugin. Hence no code changes
to your application and no issues with excel file formats any more. Looking at the
community, this library and its associated ones try to become a small and easy to
install alternative to Pandas.

In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

Usage
------

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> # make sure you had pyexcel-xls pip-installed
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")

Suppose you want to process the following excel data :

.. pyexcel-table::

   ---pyexcel:example table---
   Name,Age
   Adam,28
   Beatrice,29
   Ceri,30
   Dean,26


Here are the example usages:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> records = pe.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26
   >>> pe.free_resources()

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import os
   >>> os.unlink("your_file.xls")
