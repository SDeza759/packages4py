Signature functions
====================

Obtaining data from excel file
-------------------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   get_array
   get_dict
   get_records
   get_book_dict
   get_book
   get_sheet
   iget_book
   iget_array
   iget_records
   free_resources

Saving data to excel file
--------------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   save_as
   isave_as
   save_book_as
   isave_book_as


These flags can be passed on all signature functions:

auto_detect_int
*******************

Automatically convert float values to integers if the float number has no
decimal values(e.g. 1.00). By default, it does the detection. Setting it to
False will turn on this behavior

It has no effect on pyexcel-xlsx because it does that by default.


auto_detect_float
***********************

Automatically convert text to float values if possible. This applies only
pyexcel-io where csv, tsv, csvz and tsvz formats are supported.  By default,
it does the detection. Setting it to False will turn on this behavior


auto_detect_datetime
**********************

Automatically convert text to python datetime if possible. This applies only
pyexcel-io where csv, tsv, csvz and tsvz formats are supported.  By default,
it does the detection. Setting it to False will turn on this behavior


library
**************

Name a pyexcel plugin to handle a file format. In the situation where multiple
plugins were pip installed, it is confusing for pyexcel on which plugin to
handle the file format. For example, both pyexcel-xlsx and pyexcel-xls reads
xlsx format. Now since version 0.2.2, you can pass on `library="pyexcel-xls"`
to handle xlsx in a specific function call.

It is better to uninstall the unwanted pyexcel plugin using pip if two plugins
for the same file type are not absolutely necessary.
